Hi, my name is James Munday. I am a PhD Student at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics and in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Toronto. My supervisor is Kevin Costello.

I am interested in homological algebra and algebraic geometry, and their applications in quantum field theory and string theory. In particular, I am interested in studying a more mathematically rigorous version of the AdS/CFT correspondence, known as twisted holography.
