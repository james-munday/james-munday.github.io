Hi, my name is James Munday. I am a Resident PhD Student at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics and I am a student in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Toronto. My supervisor is Prof. Kevin Costello.

I am interested in homological algebra and algebraic geometry, along with their applications in quantum field theory and string theory. In particular, I am interested in mathematically rigorous versions of the AdS/CFT correspondence, known as twisted holography.
