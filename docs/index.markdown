Hi, my name is James Munday. I am a PhD Student at the [Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics][pitp] and in the [Department of Mathematics][dept-math] at the University of Toronto. My supervisor is [Kevin Costello][kevin].

I am interested in homological algebra and algebraic geometry, and their applications in quantum field theory and string theory.
