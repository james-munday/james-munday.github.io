Hi, I'm James.

I am a PhD student at the [Perimeter Institute][pitp] and in the [Department of Mathematics][dept-math] at the University of Toronto. My supervisor is [Kevin Costello][kevin].

I did my undergraduate degree at [Dalhousie University][https://www.dal.ca], in Halifax, Nova Scotia. In 2022, I earned a Combined Honours degree in Mathematics and Physics. During my time at Dalhousie, I participated in several summer research projects:
- Attempting to rediscover the WKB approximation from homological perturbation theory with [Theo Johnson-Freyd][theo] (2022).
- Constructing a new family of exceptional orthogonal polynomials with [Robert Milson][rob] (2021).
- Analyzing the orbit of the binary star system VV Cephei with [Philip Bennett][phil] (2020).

Following this, I did my master's degree at the [Perimeter Institute][pitp] and the [University of Waterloo][uw], as part of the 2022-23 [Perimeter Scolars International][psi] (PSI) class. My master's thesis, entitled "Twisted Holography: N=4 Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory with a Wilson Line," was supervised by [Kevin Costello][kevin].

That's how I ended up where I am today.
