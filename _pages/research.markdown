Most broadly, my research interests lie in mathematical physics, that is, the development of mathematics for tackling new physics problems.

My research so far has focused on twisting [supersymmetric quantum field theories][susy-qft] and [string theories][st]. This is a procedure which takes in a more complicated field theory and outputs one that is more mathematically tractable. In particular, I have been studying twisted holography, a more rigorous version of the [AdS/CFT correspondence][ads-cft].

These types of physical problems are often amenable to techniques from [homological algebra][hom-alg] and [derived algebraic geometry][dg-alg-geo].
